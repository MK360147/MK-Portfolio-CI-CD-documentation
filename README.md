This is a public repo for documenting a private repo and to only show code review of the protfolio. The main reason why I made a repository for my website is that I want to implement CI/CD to automate the workflow to make this easy, smooth and safe for making changes.

## Implementation of CI/CD to this project
 > As this moment and time, this project and documentation is under development
